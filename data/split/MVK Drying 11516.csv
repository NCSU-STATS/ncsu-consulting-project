Drying Notes 01/15/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Catalysts in chamber were replaced today. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bottles 3'A-D PCG 1/14/2016 transferred to oak ridge bottle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oak ridge tube centrifuged in Becman at 4C, 5000rpm and for 15min.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Didn't have as much cells as I expected this week.  Could be due to reducing agent being made with water that had O2 in it or the wrong cells.  The pellet was whiter and fluffier than I am used to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pellet had cracks after coming out of the Beckman centrifuge. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rinsed with 20 mL PCG 1/11/2016 1YCM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tube centrifuged in rotana for 15min at 4C and 6000rcf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coatings A-E removed as soon as made with humidity test strip in tube. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A-E Flushed with 5.0 psi Argon for 2 min then placed in the dark at 115pm awaiting move back into chamber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coatings F-K left to dry for 60 minutes with 6 humidity strips also placed in transfer chamber while drying went on. Then transferred to tubes with coatings. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
K wasn't able to be fully coated with entire volume because ran out of cells.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
F-K were flushed with 5.0 psi argon for 2 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A-K moved into chamber at 2:55 PM and covered to keep dark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehydration Notes 01/18/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Humidity strips in tubes A and B turned a dark purple, black color toward the bottom and were pink at the top, never reaching the lavender color where they should be read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possibly because humidity exceeded level able to be detected by the strip or because flow rate out of valves is not even and some tubes got more/less argon than others when flushed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tube C was pink throughout as well but not purple like Tubes A and B even though they were the same; could be due to valve flow rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes D-K all had humidities around 10% being read from the strip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4mL of 50 mL 1YCM 2mL CYS PCG 1/11/16 were used to rehydrate all tubes at approximately 10:15 AM. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All tubes were flushed with syngas at 10 psi for 2 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All tubes placed in shaker at 100 rpm, 37C at 10:40 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Testing humidity strip to see if humidity exceeds the 60% able to read if the strip turns purple like what happened in tubes A and B. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The strip didn't turn black in an 80% humidity environment. Maybe the strip put in tubes A & B were cut from the same original strip and were just a fluke thing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shaker was accidentally set to 100rpm at the beginning of the experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"consequently, tubes A, C, F, and H were completely underwater with G being very twisted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assaying Notes 01/19/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes removed from shaker and assayed at 10:00 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes returned to shaker at 10:09 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assaying Notes 01/20/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes that were reactive were reassayed the next day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This included tubes A, H, and J. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Removed from shaker and assayed at 12:50 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes returned to shaker at 12:55 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
