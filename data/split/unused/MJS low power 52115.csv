purpose: see the difference in concentration with different liquid volumes having a control to substract out what the cells have inside them from the rich media (what the rinse doesn't touch),,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES:,,,,,,,,Formulations ,,,
Started with 2'A and 2'B at 9am,,,,,,,,cells,media,total,
OD600 of 2'C at 915am is 1.4: The new stock solutions might have improved growth a little,,,,,,,,#1 ,0.3,,
rinsed with 24mL of 1YCM between spins,,,,,,,,420,980,1400,
into shaker at 1130,,,,,,,,,,,
Removed from shaker and gas samples taken at 1130am on 5/22/15. No CO in any samples,,,,,,,,,,,
"OD and liquid samples taken at 2pm. Samples remained sealed until then.  coatings removed, tube vortexed, then samples taken",,,,,,,,,,,
"I hope that wasn't too long between and GC and OD/liquid.  They were upright on the bench that whole time, so I don't expect that there was much reacting going on.",,,,,,,,,,,
