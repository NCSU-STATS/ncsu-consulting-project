"Michelle assays samples. Puts 4 bottles of mRCMf and 2 bottles of 1YCM (reduced with 1mL CYS, I reduced 11/6/15)"

Wednesday
morning
"Cody takes ODs of all 4 bottles. If there is a significant different between OTA1 2mL and 3mL let me know, but it shouldn't be a problem.  Transfer 5mL from 3mL OTA1 to 2'A-D in mRCMF. Transfer 3mL from 1'A WT to 2'A,2'B 1YCM"
