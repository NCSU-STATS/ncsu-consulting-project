Combined OTA 1 3'A-D PCG 2/25/16 in oakridge bottle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First spin in Beckman at 11:10 AM for 15 min at 5000 rpm, 4C. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rinsed with 20 mL from 50 mL bottle of 1YCM PCG 1/25/16 with 2 mL Cys and 0.2 M NaOH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pellet was extra ""sticky"" after first centrifuge. I had to blast it with media several times before it began loosening. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tube centrifuged in rotana for 15min at 4C and 6000rcf at 11:43 AM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coatings A-L and M-O were made first; while they were flushing P-R were made and hung to dry in the chamber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes A-L flushed at 20 psi with argon for 25 minutes at the door station.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes M-O flused at 20 psi with argon for 25 minutes under the hood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes P-R flushed at 20 psi with argon for 2 minutes at th door station. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All tubes placed in their respective locations by 3:00 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehydration Notes: 2/29/16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes removed from locations at 11:00 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each tube rehydrated with 4 mL of 1YCM PCG 2/9/16 1 mL 2.5% cys 0.2 N NaOH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flushed with syngas with green needles at 20 psi for 2 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All tubes placed in shaker at 11:42 AM at 50 RPM and 37C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tubes M-R sampled at approxmimately 10:50 AM and returned to shaker at 10:55 AM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sample H had strange oxygen peaks; rerun with different syringe at 11:00 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sample H had two CO2 peaks come out because of reinjection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sampled and run again at 11:15 AM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Running C, H, I, and J again since O2 peaks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
