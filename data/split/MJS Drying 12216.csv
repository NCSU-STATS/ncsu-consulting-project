started first spin at 1110am,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All bottles were mRCMf PCG 1/11/16 reduced with 3mL CYS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1YCM bottels were reduced the night before and put in the shaker to make sure all the O2 was consumed by the reducing agent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the first spin, each oak ridge tube resuspended in 10mL of 1YCM reduced with 1mL CYS PCG 1/11/16",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cell types were kept separate throughout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anaerobic chamber was at 0.5% before I started and after 2nd spin, there was no discoloration in the media",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after the second spin, I dumped the supernatant into the waste container and it turn pink, which freaked me out.  It went back to clear, though.  Must have been from the water droplets left in the container from the rinse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly 950uL OTA1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly 550uL WT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PQR were coated after vacuum was started for others and left in anaerobic chamber during vacuum period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 10psi, the flush isn't very strong.  Do we need to consider a higher pressure because our needles are so small so that we can get some good flow?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rehydration Notes 01/25/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chamber was at 0.5% Hydrogen and 000 PPM oxygen when started.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tubes A-C, G-I, and P-R rehydrated with 2 bottles of 25 mL 1 YCM 1 mL Cys PCG 1/11/16",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes D-F and J-O rehydrated with 50mL 1 YCM 0.4 mL 1754 PCG 1/11/16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All rehydration done at approximately 1:20 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All tubes were flushed with syngas at 10 psi for 2 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All tubes placed in shaker at 50 rpm, 37C at 2:06 PM. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
