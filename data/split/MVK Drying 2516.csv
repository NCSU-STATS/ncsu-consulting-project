Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All substrates were 2X13cm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4mL is to be added when rehydrated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coated surface area is 10cm^2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shaker speed is 50rpm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coating volume is 200uL per strip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Substrate is 3MM chromatography paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All flushing for drying is done with green needles 21G,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Drying Notes 2/5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chamber flushed until H level was at 00.5 before starting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bottles used were 3' A-D OTA 1 mRCMF PCG 1/26/16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First spin in Beckman at 11:05 AM for 15 min at 5000 rpm, 4C. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rinsed with 20 mL from 25 mL bottle of 1YCM PCG 1/25/16 with 1 mL Cys and 0.1 M NaOH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tube centrifuged in rotana for 15min at 4C and 6000rcf at 11:38 AM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total volume of the pellet is ~1600uL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flushed with Argon at 20 psi for specified durations with green (21G) needles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G-O and P-R were flushed with argon at flushing station by the door; all other tubes flushed with argon under hood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Placed in anaerobic chamber at 3:18 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehydration Notes 2/8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Began rehydration with tubes J, K, and L; media turned pink once in tubes but media in vial didn't change color. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Likely a result of new pipettes being brought in without time to equilibrate to anoxic as nothing else changed color,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehydrated with 4mL of 1 YCM 50 mL PCG 1/25/16 2.5% Cys and various amounts of NaOH for different pH levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rehydration occured at approximately 11:25 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All tubes were flushed with syngas at 10 psi for 2 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Strips were slightly twisted in tubes: D (has crinkle in center of strip), L (has crinkle at bottom), R (has crinkle on bottom), S (has crinkle on bottom)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many strips straightened out after rehydration and flushing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All tubes placed in shaker at 50 rpm, 37C at 12:08 PM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Sampled tubes M-V at 4:04 PM and returned them to shaker at 4:09 PM. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assaying Notes 2/9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sampled tubes A-L at 9:58 AM and returned them to shaker at 10:05 AM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sampled tubes M-U at 11:02 AM and returned them to shaker at 11:11 AM. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tubes E and Q had an oxygen peaks when sampled, so resampled at 12:23 PM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tubes E and Q were both sampled with the syringe E; could have been left open which resulted in oxygen peak. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"K had best reactivity out of medium samples J, K, L; could be due to darker clump of cells on strip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"O had best reactivity out of high samples M, N, O; could also be due to darker clump of cells on strip. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
