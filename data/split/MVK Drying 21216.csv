Drying Notes: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25 minutes drying for everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6.4pH (0.2N NaOH),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same volume of media for each rinse, 5 or 10?",,,,,,,,How to flush at door station:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3'C OTA1 PCG 2/11/16 3 mL Transfer and  3'D OTA1 PCG 2/11/16 1 mL Transfer were put into oakridge bottles for centrifuge. ,,,,,,,,Open tank with wrench ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3'A OTA1 PCG 2/11/16 6 mL Transfer and 3'B OTA1 PCG 2/11/16 6 mL Transfer were placed in an oakridge bottle together for centrifuge,,,,,,,,Open line when pointing down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First spin in Beckman at 11:21 AM for 15 min at 5000 rpm, 4C. ",,,,,,,,above points up to be open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3'E OTA1 PCG 2/11/16 6mL transfer in mRCMf PCG 2/8/16 (newer media than others) was divided into two oakridge bottles.,,,,,,,,open everything and flush with argon ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oakridge bottles were centrifuged in rotana for 15 min at 4C and 6000rcf at 11:21 AM. ,,,,,,,,After flushed tubes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each pellet rinsed with 10mL of ,,,,,,,,close the tank ,,,,,Turbidity Ranking (from least to most turbid),,,Coating Color (from most brown to most white),,,,,,,
Tubes centrifuged in rotana for 15min at 4C and 6000rcf at 12:09 PM.,,,,,,,,20 psi,,,,,S,,,S,,,,,,,
Pellet for 3mL almost looked larger than 6mL; the 1mL look about the same size as 6 mL.,,,,,,,,open atmosphere,,,,,T,,,T,,,,,,,
"Formulations that had trehalose were smoother when making coating; not as blotchy looking, more continous and fluid when spreading on paper.",,,,,,,,stop a little before bubbles end,,,,,U,,,U,,,,,,,
Flushed with Argon at 20 psi for 25 minutes with green (21G) needles.,,,,,,,,close circle valves ,,,,,V,,,V,,,,,,,
Placed in anaerobic chamber at 3:10 PM.,,,,,,,,pull out,,,,,Q,,,F,,,,,,,

Rehydration Notes 2/15/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,R,,,E,,,,,,,
All tubes rehydrated with 4 mL of PCG 1YCM 1/19/2016 with 2mL of 0.2 N NaOH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,O,,,D,,,,,,,
Rehydration occured at approximately 12:20 PM.,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,B,,,,,,,
All tubes flushed with syngas at 20 psi using green needles (21G) for 2 minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,M,,,H,,,,,,,
"All tubes placed in shaker at 50 rpm, 37C at 12:57 PM",,,,,,,,,,,,,C,,,G,,,,,,,

Assaying Notes 2/16/2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,,,O,,,,,,,
Tubes A-L sampled at approximately 10:00 AM and returned to shaker at 10:05 AM. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,L,,,P,,,,,,,
Being mindful of syringe E since it had oxygen peaks last week -- could have been problem with way syringe was stored. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,A,,,L,,,,,,,
Syringe E had an oxygen peak again. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,E,,,I,,,,,,,
Tubes M-V sampled at approximately 11:20 AM. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,D,,,J,,,,,,,
Of trehalose concentraions -- best condition was 0.2g trehalose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,G,,,K,,,,,,,
"Of different mL of cell transfer -- 6 mL was most reactive, 3 mL was less, 1 mL was even less. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,H,,,Q,,,,,,,
From Tubes S and T -- doesn't seem like coating smaller surface area had an influence on reactivity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,I,,,M,,,,,,,
From Tubes U and V -- doesn't seem like drierite made a difference.,,,,,,,,,,J,,,N,,,,,,,,,,
Syringe E valve tightened and tested again -- oxygen peak is gone! ,,,,,,,,,,K,,,R,,,,,,,,,,
