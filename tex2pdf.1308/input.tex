\subsection{Bacteria Drying}\label{bacteria-drying}

Scientists study bacteria for a variety of reasons. Bacteria have been
the source of great human suffering and more recently it has become
known that bacteria are also an important part of human health. In
addition to matters of human health and disease, scientists study
bacteria as forms of alternative energy and bio-remediation. The ability
to store bacteria for long periods of time is an important research
objective. Scientists need to be able to keep libraries of bacteria to
compare bacterial populations over time and to share bacteria among
colleagues. For alternative energy purposes, if bacteria can reliably be
dried and re-hydrated then growth plants do not have to be collocated
with productions plants. This has the potential to effectively make
bacteria a stored energy source. For bio-remediation if bacteria can be
reliably re-hydrated on site then deployment becomes easier as storing
and transporting the bacteria in a dehydrated state is more cost
effective.

This study aims to evaluate a variety of bacterial drying methodologies
to determine optimal conditions for re-hydration. The specific aim is to
have mechanism capable of producing ethanol/acetate at rates higher than
20\% of undried bacteria. Variables used in the drying process include
the addition of chemicals, different mechanisms for removal of oxygen,
and different storage conditions. Samples from the same bacterial
population are exposed to different drying mechanisms, are re-hydrated,
and then measured for anaerobic respiration. The population surviving
the drying process is measured through the amount of carbon monoxide
produced after re-hydration. Increasing numbers of bacteria that survive
the drying process lead to decreasing carbon monoxide levels. Since this
measurement is the sum of many small contributions we expect the
response to be normally distributed. The overall goals are to find the
conditions which minimize the carbon monoxide levels - thus providing
optimal conditions for bacteria re-hydration.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Method introduction}\label{method-introduction}

The bacteria drying experiments are carried out carefully in a
traditional biological laboratory. Bacteria are grown in culture media
prior to the experiments and samples from the same media are used in the
different experiments for drying and storage. After storage bacteria are
re-hydrated in individual tubes which are first evacuated with argon and
then infused with hydrogen and carbon dioxide to enable respiration.
Treatments are grouped into experiments and carried out by different
individuals. There are two phases to the experiment - a drying phase and
a re-hydration phase. The treatment could be present in the drying phase
or the re-hydration phase. The design is both qualitative and
quantitative in the treatments applied.

Vacuum exposure is known to cause damage to bacteria cell membranes and
that there is a repair mechanism for eliminating the
damage(Frankenberg-Schwager et al. 1975). This study noted that the
damage can be repaired after storage when the temperature is raised.
It's also know that freeze-drying can cause genetic injuries in bacteria
with the number of mutations increasing with the length of the storage
time (Ashwood-Smith 1980). These are just some of the underlying factors
that the experiments will be implicitly measuring.

Detailed notes are included with the experiments indicating any
anomalies in them, and describing the lab procedures and materials used.
Bacteria are grown from 7 cultures which are used in the experiments.
Each sample is a unit of a cell formulation which is dried, stored, and
then re-hydrated. Media is spun in a Beckman, and then rinsed with 20 mL
from 25 mL bottle of 1YCM PCG with 1 mL Cys and 0.2 M NaOH. After that
the sample is tube centrifuged in rotana for 15min at 4C and 6000rcf.
After drying tubes are tubes flushed with argon at 20 psi for 25 minutes
and then stored.

An experiment generally contains 10-25 formulations. In all there are 43
experiments with 775 samples. 73 samples have missing responses which
are redacted from the analysis. The measures for this study are the
experiment ID's which encode the conditions for the experiment and
response conditions of the outcome. The responses are measures of
cellular respiration; H2,O2,N2,CO CO2.

\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

We will be investigating a several approaches to analyzing this data.
The freest step will be to implement a 1 way ANOVA on the experiment and
treatment. This will determine if the mean responses of the experiment
are different. The model we use is that the repose \(y_{ij}\) of
replicate \(i\) in the \(j\) is expressed as
\({\displaystyle y_{i,j}=\mu +\tau _{j}+\varepsilon _{i,j}}\) where
\({\displaystyle i=1,\dotsc ,I}\) an index over the replicates
\({\displaystyle j=1,\dotsc ,J}\) is the index over experiments,
\({\displaystyle \mu _{j}}\) is the mean of the CO measurements for
experiment \(j\),\({\displaystyle \mu }\) is the overall mean CO, and
\(\tau_j\) is the treatment effect for experiment \(j\) - a deviation
from the overall mean. The errors
\(\epsilon_{i \;j} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\) are normally distributed with
equal variance.

The response is assumed to be normal but we perform a non parametric
Kruskal-Wallis (Kruskal and Wallis 1952) one-way analysis of variance by
ranks for validation of the one way ANOVA, and as an precursor to
selecting the optimal experimental conditions. The Kruskall-Wallis
analysis of variance is an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test to
multiple groups. We expect the Kruskal-Wallis result will be consistent
with the usual 1 way ANOVA. The assumption of the Kruskal-Wallis is that
all the groups come from identical distributions with common variance.
The null hypothesis is the medians are all the same for the groups.
Using the notation above, the hypothesis are

\[H_0 : P(\mu_j > \mu_k) = \frac{1}{2} \;\; \large{\forall} \;\; j,k \in 1,\dotsc ,J\]

\[H_a : \large \exists \;\;j,k \;\;\in 1,\dotsc ,J  :   P(\mu_j > \mu_k) \neq \frac{1}{2} \]
A significant Kruskal-Wallis test indicates that at least one
experimental median stochastically dominates the others. We do not know
which one. The common options for determining stochastic order are to
perform pairwise Mann-Whitney tests or to perform Dunn's Multiple
Comparison Test (Dunn 1961). Dunn's test has several technical
advantages over running pairwise Mann-Whitney tests. The main advantages
are that it uses the pooled variance estimate from the Kruskal-Wallis
test, and that it reuses the average rank scores from the Kruskal-Wallis
test. Appendix A {[}REVISIT{]} contains a detailed description of the
Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests.

The input to the Dunn test is the per group average rank
\(\bar{R_j} = \frac{R_j}{n_j}\) and the z-test statistic for groups
\(j,k\) is

\[z_{j,k} = \frac{\bar{R_j} - \bar{R_k}}{\sigma_{j,k}}\]
\(\sigma_{j,k}\) is a funtion of the overall, group, and rank tie counts
(see appendix A). The null hypothesis of the group pairwise comparison
is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the
first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the
second groups is one half - \(H_0 : P(X_j > X_k) = \frac{1}{2}\).

The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability
of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is
larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one
half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test.

The Kruskal-Wallis is implemented in R in the \texttt{kruskal.test}
function in the core \texttt{stats} package. The Dunn test is
implemented in the \texttt{dunn.test} package. R version 3.4.2
(2017-09-28) is used to perform the analysis.

\subsection{Data Description and
Preparation}\label{data-description-and-preparation}

An excel workbook is kept with the experimental data and other lab
notes. This consists of 63 worksheets which are pre-processed from the
lab workbook into a series of files suitable for ingest into an R data
frame object. An Excel VBA script is run to extract the individual
experiments into csv files and the resulting files were investigated for
inclusion in the data analysis. Not all of the worksheet in the data
workbook contain experimental data. After looking at each file - there
were 44 experiments eligible for inclusion in the data analysis. Of
these 44 one was determined to not have any response measurements and
was redacted from the statistical analysis.

\subsubsection{VBA Extract}\label{vba-extract}

This is the listing of code for the extract of worksheets from excel to
csv format.

\begin{verbatim}
Private Sub SaveAllSheetsAsCSV()
On Error GoTo Heaven

' each sheet reference
Dim Sheet As Worksheet
' path to output to
Dim OutputPath As String
' name of each csv
Dim OutputFile As String

Application.ScreenUpdating = False
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
Application.EnableEvents = False

' ask the user where to save
OutputPath = InputBox("Enter a directory to save to", "Save to directory", Path)

If OutputPath <> "" Then

    ' save for each sheet
    For Each Sheet In Sheets

        OutputFile = OutputPath & "\" & Sheet.Name & ".csv"

        ' make a copy to create a new book with this sheet
        ' otherwise you will always only get the first sheet
        Sheet.Copy
        ' this copy will now become active
        ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=OutputFile, FileFormat:=xlCSV, CreateBackup:=False
        ActiveWorkbook.Close
    Next

End If

Finally:
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
Application.DisplayAlerts = True
Application.EnableEvents = True

Exit Sub

Heaven:
MsgBox "Couldn't save all sheets to CSV." & vbCrLf & _
        "Source: " & Err.Source & " " & vbCrLf & _
        "Number: " & Err.Number & " " & vbCrLf & _
        "Description: " & Err.Description & " " & vbCrLf

GoTo Finally
End Sub
